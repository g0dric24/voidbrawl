# Contributing to VOIDBRAWL

VOIDBRAWL is built to a standard. This document states that standard. Read it before you open a pull request.

The core rule: **no slop.** Every change must be understood, specified, reviewed, and tested. A change that
"works" but nobody can explain is not acceptable. Machine-generated code is welcome only when it meets the
same bar as hand-written code — the author is responsible for every line, whatever wrote it.

---

## 1. Read before you write

The repository already holds its own rules. You must read the relevant ones first.

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** — how we build. Start here.
2. **`conventions/*.md`** — the source-verified idioms for each subsystem (Colyseus, React Router, R3F, ECS,
   netcode, monorepo). **Read the one that covers the code you touch.** These are not suggestions. They are
   **acceptance criteria** — a pull request that violates a convention is rejected, even if it compiles and
   the tests pass.
3. **`docs/`** — GDD, TDD, ADD, AUDIO. The design intent. Do not diverge from it silently; update it.

## 2. Every feature needs an RFC / spec

**No feature or non-trivial fix lands without a written spec first.** This is the anti-slop gate.

1. **Open a GitHub issue** for the work. The issue is the RFC.
2. **State the problem before the solution.** What is broken or missing? What does success look like? What
   are the constraints?
3. **Describe the design.** What you will change, where, and why. Name the alternatives you rejected and the
   reason. Name the trade-offs you accept.
4. **List the test plan.** How will you prove it works?
5. **Get agreement before you write the implementation.** For anything that changes shared behaviour, wait
   for a maintainer to approve the design on the issue.

We follow a 6-phase arc: **Ideate → Brainstorm → Prep → Align → Implement → Reconcile** (see `.claude/phases/`
for examples). The RFC covers Ideate through Align. Code belongs to Implement. **Do not write the
implementation during the thinking phases.** Trivial changes (a typo, a one-line fix) may skip the arc.

## 3. Coding standards

- **TypeScript, strict, ESM everywhere.** No `any` escapes without a written reason. No CommonJS.
- **Match the surrounding code.** Copy its naming and its idioms. New code must read like it was always
  there. **Comments are the exception — never copy them upward.** A file that still carries a prose comment
  is not a licence to add another; leave it lighter than you found it.
- **No comments at all — except `setTimeout`, `setInterval` and `useEffect`.** Code says what it does in
  names, types and control flow. Anything a reader cannot get from those — a rejected alternative, an
  external constraint, a non-obvious consequence, a unit — goes in the PR body, where someone reading the
  change wants it, instead of the file, where everyone reading the function pays for it forever. "Why, not
  what" is not a permit: a *why* the reader can already see, and a seven-line account of how a bug was
  found, both go. **Exactly three constructs may carry a comment, one line each:** `setTimeout`,
  `setInterval`, `useEffect` — for an Effect that line names the outside-React system it synchronizes with,
  and an uncommented Effect is still a review failure ("Anti-patterns" below). Nothing else gets one: no
  file headers, no section banners, no JSDoc, no tuning notes in `constants.ts`. Functional directives are
  not prose and are exempt: `biome-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`, `@vitest-environment`, `/// <reference`,
  shebangs. **`pnpm lint` measures this.** A file you touch may not come out with more comment lines than
  it went in with. Two successive judgement-based bars ("only what the code cannot say") drifted back into
  10–20 line blocks; the bar is mechanical now, so there is nothing left to judge.
- **Never cite a bare number.** `(D7)`, `ADR-006`, `§4`, `#118` alone are useless to a reader — looking one
  up costs them the context they were holding, which is worse than no citation at all. Inline the substance,
  then cite the location.
- **Follow the house React style** (`conventions/r3f.md`): `<Fragment>`, never `<>`; one component per file
  (React Router route modules are the only exception).
- **Respect the project non-negotiables** in `CLAUDE.md` — server-authoritative, inputs-not-positions, one
  shared `simulate()`, no per-frame React re-renders in gameplay, `@voidbrawl/shared` is compiled not
  source-consumed, ship stats are data.
- **No Python** for tooling or scripts. Use `jq`/`yq`, then `fish`/`bash`, then the ecosystem's native tools.

## 4. Tests are required where possible

- **The shared simulation (`packages/shared`) MUST have tests.** It is deterministic and server-authoritative.
  Every invariant a human playtest cannot cheaply assert belongs in `*.test.ts`. Add a test with the change,
  not after.
- **For other code, add a test when the surface can be tested** (a pure function, a reducer, a data
  transform). Rendering and feel are gated by a human playtest instead — say so in the pull request.
- **A bug fix starts with a failing test** that reproduces the bug, where the code allows it.

## 5. Anti-patterns — not allowed

These are rejected on sight. Each one has already cost this project real time.

- **Coupling a long-lived resource to a React lifecycle.** The Colyseus room, sockets, subscriptions, and
  timers live on module singletons — never in a `useEffect` cleanup. (This bug cost us S2.)
- **`useEffect` as the default.** It is an escape hatch, for synchronizing with systems *outside* React.
  Reach for the idiomatic mechanism first: derive during render, handle events in handlers, flow data through
  React Router loaders/actions, use refs for imperative work. Every surviving `useEffect` carries **one line
  naming the outside-React system it synchronizes with** — that is the whole comment; the idioms it rejected
  go in the PR body (§3, and `CLAUDE.md` non-negotiable #15).
- **Per-frame React re-renders in gameplay.** Drive the scene from ECS via refs and instancing in
  `useFrame`. React is never in the movement path.
- **Reading Colyseus state during React render.** It is not React-reactive. Read it through the loader +
  `.listen`, and pass it as props. ("Works after HMR" is the tell that you got this wrong.)
- **Syncing positions instead of inputs.** Clients send sequence-numbered inputs. The server owns positions.
- **Syncing arena geometry.** The arena is deterministic from a descriptor. Sync the descriptor.
- **Source-consuming `@voidbrawl/shared`.** It is `tsc`-compiled to `dist`. The `@colyseus/schema` decorator
  config makes source consumption a silent wire-corruption bug.
- **`Math.random()` / `Date.now()` / `Math.sin` inside the deterministic sim.** They break determinism.
  Use seeded, deterministic math (e.g. a triangle wave for pacing). Client-only cosmetics may use them.
- **Fragment shorthand `<>`** and **more than one component per file** (see house style).
- **A reflexive `setInterval`/`setTimeout` polling live game state.** A HUD or system that spins its own timer
  to sample `room.state`/ECS when the frame loop is the right clock (it under-samples the patch stream and
  drifts as a second clock). Per-frame work *outside* the Canvas rides R3F **`addEffect`** (global per-frame
  callback); DOM that belongs *in* the scene uses drei **`<Html>`**/`createPortal` driven by `useFrame`; shared
  per-frame values flow through the existing loop, never a private timer. Enumerate ≥5 mechanisms and pick the
  purpose-built one (non-negotiable #14). (Cost us a redundant clock in PR #85.)
- **A hand-rolled `style={{}}` object for DOM UI when Tailwind is configured.** DOM UI is Tailwind classes;
  arbitrary values cover the exotic cases (`bg-[radial-gradient(...)]`, `inset-0`, `z-20`). A single *dynamic*
  value (e.g. proximity→opacity) is driven imperatively through a **CSS custom property** the classes read
  (`el.style.setProperty('--threat', x)` + `opacity-[var(--threat)]`), never a full inline style object copied
  from training habit (non-negotiable #13). (PR #85.)

## 6. The verify gate

Before you open a pull request, all of these must pass from the repository root:

```
pnpm typecheck    # tsc across shared/server/client
pnpm lint         # biome + ls-lint
pnpm test         # the shared sim tests + the Colyseus room tests
pnpm build        # topological build, catches bad imports
```

`pnpm test` runs every package that declares a `test` script. Do **not** substitute
`pnpm --filter @voidbrawl/shared test` — that skips the server room tests entirely.

Green CI is necessary but **not sufficient** — it does not prove idiom-correctness (see §1). A reviewer still
checks the change against the conventions.

## 7. Commits and pull requests

- **Conventional commits:** `feat(client): …`, `fix(shared): …`, `docs: …`. Scope by package.
- **One logical change per pull request.** Batch the files that belong together (entity + schema + test);
  do not mix unrelated changes.
- **Link the issue** (the RFC) the pull request implements.
- **State how you verified it** — the gate output, and the manual playtest if the change has a feel or visual
  surface.

## 8. Writing standard

All contributor-facing documents and technical prose follow **ASD-STE100 (Simplified Technical English)**
where applicable: short sentences, active voice, one instruction per sentence, approved vocabulary, no
needless synonyms. Evocative design pitch and flavour copy keep their voice. When clarity and voice conflict
in technical text, clarity wins.

## 9. Assets

Every third-party asset must be freely licensed (CC0 preferred; CC-BY with attribution). **Record it in
`CREDITS.md`** — and add the required attribution line for any CC-BY asset. No asset lands without its
provenance recorded.

**Binary assets are Git-LFS-tracked** (the ship `.gltf` models under `apps/client/public/models/ships/`). A
fresh clone must run `git lfs install && git lfs pull` **before** `pnpm install` — otherwise the models clone
as LFS pointer text and the client fails to load them with a misleading `Unexpected token 'v'` JSON error
(R3F parsing the pointer as GLTF), not a clear "install git-lfs". Same step is needed before you drive the app
in the verify gate. See the README's "Run it" section.
